## QnA

### Why C and Python 3?  
Because, I know both C and Python 3 rather well, and I am not about to deal with internet things with C. 

### Why not use OBS/streamlabs?  
Well my access to OBS is restricted because of hardware, and I lack access to streamlabs OBS because of software. You see, I run Linux, not Windows (specifically Devuan Linux 32bit). Because of this I can't run streamlabs OBS as it requires Windows. I can't use OBS because the Multiplatform version requires OpenGL 3, which my hardware lacks support for. While I can use a software renderer, it has horrible performance and doesn't really work well for streaming. So I use [SimpleScreenRecorder](http://www.maartenbaert.be/simplescreenrecorder/) for my streams. 

Unfortuantely it isn't as fully-featured as OBS, and doesn't do things like overlays and multiple sources. So I have to take it in my own hands. In the end I eneded up making these programs. Please note that they WILL display things on screen for you, so keep that in mind.

### Was this all streamed?  
I tried to stream as much as possible, but things like updating this README or updating other documentation is occasionally done off-stream, as it's relatively minor.

### What is TBW?  
It means To Be Written. I use it as a space to denote that I left something incomplete to return to it later. It may also be used to denote that I plan to work on it in the next stream or off-stream as the stream is ending soon.
